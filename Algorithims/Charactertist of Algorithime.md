Input – An algorithm should have zero or more inputs.

Output – An algorithm should produce at least one output.

Definiteness – Each step should be clear and unambiguous.

Finiteness – An algorithm must terminate after a finite number of steps.

Effectiveness – Each step must be basic enough to be carried out in practice.
