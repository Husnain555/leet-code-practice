Priori Analysis

Done at the algorithm level.

Independent of programming language, hardware, and operating system.

Focuses on time and space complexity functions.

Posteriori Analysis

Done at the program level.

Dependent on programming language, hardware, and operating system.

Based on actual execution (e.g., stopwatch for time, bytes for memory).
