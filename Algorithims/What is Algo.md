Difference Between an Algorithm and a Program
Algorithm

We design algorithms.

A person with domain knowledge creates algorithms.

Independent of programming language and hardware.

We analyze algorithms.

Program

We implement programs.

A programmer writes programs.

Dependent on programming language and hardware.

We test programs (code).
