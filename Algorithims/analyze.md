How to Analyze an Algorithm

Suppose we want to analyze a simple algorithm like a swap function:

function swap(a, b) {
let temp = a;
a = b;
b = temp;
return [a, b];
}


When analyzing an algorithm, we usually consider several factors:

1. Time Complexity

How many basic operations (assignments, comparisons, loops, etc.) the algorithm takes relative to the input size.

In this swap example, the algorithm performs 3 assignments, which is O(1) (constant time).

2. Space Complexity

How much extra memory the algorithm requires.

The swap function uses one temporary variable (temp), so extra space = O(1) (constant space).

3. CPU Usage / Power Consumption (optional in most theoretical analysis)

In practical systems, CPU cycles and power matter.

Since the swap has only a few instructions, its CPU usage is minimal.

4. Network Consumption

Only relevant if the algorithm involves communication across systems.

For this swap example, there is no network usage.

5. Register / Hardware Usage

On a very low level, compilers and processors may optimize the swap using registers instead of memory.

In theory, we usually donâ€™t count this, but in systems programming or embedded systems, it can matter.
